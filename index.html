										<h2>My Profile</h2>
										<p>About Me</p> 
									</header>
									<p>Hi, I'm Adam Stowers, I've grown up in Australia. I'm a native English speaker and I know some basic Japanese. I have a certificate IV in meat processing and I'm a qualified meat inspector, I search for parasites and zoonotic disease in bovine and ovine in a post mortem inspection day to day. In my spare time I build, fly, crash and rebuild race drones. 

									</p>
									<h3>My Interest In I.T</h3>
									<p>My interest in information technology has come from drone building and programming. It has since grown from small Arduino projects using simplified C++ to learning real C++. I like using coding to make things do what I want them to do. I like being able to see how the changes I have made in the coding affect the hardware or even a website, as well as the overall project in different ways. It has given me a new way of looking at how the world around me was made. It also shows me what possibilities could present themselves in the future. 
									<H3>How My Interest In I.T Started</H3>
									</p>
									<p>Information technology first intrigued me in 1998 the day the we got our first computer. Months later, while waiting 45 minutes for an image loading in photoshop, I remember taking the side panel off the computer case. While looking at all of the hardware, I remember thinking “how does all of this work?”  

										We didn’t have the Internet at that time so I couldn’t look it up and no one I asked seemed to know how it worked. That was about the time that I started taking apart every electronic device that wasn’t bolted down to the ground in an attempt to find out. 
										
										 </p>
										 <p> At about the same time our first computer arrived in our house I received a Lego Mindstorms robotics discovery kit as a gift. The robotics kit had light sensors, touch sensors and motors. It was possible to program your robot to move in different directions. It was then possible to program your robot to react to touch and light input with different motor outputs. This was life changing to me to see how this computer could react to the outside world through input output commands, it gave me my first piece of understanding of what was going on inside computers. 
										 </p>
										 <h3>My Experience In I.T </h3>
										 <p>Experience in fusion 360 creating .stl files for 3d printing, creating basic machine pathways generating G-code. 
											<br><br>
											3d printing
											Laptop upgrades like HDD, SSD, RAM 
											<br><br>
											I have played with cloned Multiwii, GRBL, Universal G-code sender repositories on GitHub. 
											<br><br>
											Experience using the Arduino ide using simplified C++. 
											<br><br>
											Soldering.  
											<br><br>
											Electrical circuits. 
											<br><br>
											C++ creating testing and changing terminal input programs in Visual Studio using:

										 </p>
										 <h3>Why do I study at R.M.I.T? </h3>
										 <p>Almost 4 months ago while working I cut a ligament in my finger that required micro surgery to be reattached. My finger is fully healed now and I have full functionality of my finger but I have decided to soon leave the meat industry with all of my fingers still attached! </p>
										 <p>I chose to study at RMIT and pursue the Bachelor of Information Technology because I was sure that it would be a way for me to leave the meat industry and get my foot in the door in the IT industry which, is an industry that coincides with my interests outside of work it also has lots of entry level jobs that I will soon be applying for to kickstart my new career pathway. </p>
										 <p>I would like to learn the foundation skills that are used in the information technology industry to help me find a job in I.T. I would then like to grow my knowledge in every direction learning how to meet deadlines and communicate effectively to different types of people in the industry. I would also like to learn how to solve problems, make informed decisions and gain skills such as learning programming languages, learning about databases and their practical application, learning how to keep computers secure, software engineering, app design etc.  

											I want to learn everything and I have the rest of my life to do it.

									<h3>Personal Profile</h3>
									<H4>Myers Briggs Personality type </H4>
									<h5>INTP-A</h5>
									<p>Being an INTP-A Its quite an honor to have the same personality type as Albert Einstein. I have been described as an absent-minded professor several times in my life.  I enjoy finding patterns and spotting things that don’t add up. My mind never stops thinking about how things work and the endless possibilities that the world throws my way. I'm usually pretty quiet only asking questions during a conversation, until someone asks me a question that I know everything about then it's difficult to get a word in. 

									</p>
									<p>My fear of failure is the driving force that helps me make deadlines even though I have to check over everything in an almost obsessive-compulsive way. I guess in a way I am a perfectionist, but I have never had the time to make anything truly perfect because everything can always be better. This frustrates me, but I go with it anyway. 

									</p>
									<H3>Learning Styles Test</H3>
									<h4>Visual Learner </h4>
									<p> 

										I have been aware that I am a visual learner for some time, I had to recently buy a second desk because I kept getting side tracked by all of the interesting things that I had sitting on my desk. I learn well from watching hundreds of hours of YouTube/The Great Courses Plus tutorials in my own time and writing tests for myself instead of notes, then the questions I get wrong require hundreds more hours of watched tutorials and more tests. 
									</p>
								
								<H3>Big Five Personality Test</H3>
								<h4>
									O=92%
									<span style=padding-left:40px;>
									C=29%
									<span style=padding-left:40px;>	
									E=40%
									<span style=padding-left:40px;>
									A=62.5%
									<span style=padding-left:40px;>
									N=33% 
								</h4>
								<p> 
									The big five personality test showed me that I was creative and intellectual, easily side tracked, that I didn’t experience much joy from social achievements, I sometimes put others needs ahead of my own and that I don’t experience negative emotions often. 

								</p>
								<h3>In A Team</h3>
								<p>
									These test results show that in a team environment I would dive in to solving abstract problems in my own original way. I like to have a deep understanding so that I can create my own solutions to problems through a huge understanding of the subject at hand. 

								</p>
							
								<p>
									I show up to work to work, I don’t care much for general chatting and formalities instead of talking about the weather, I will offer endless theoretical options and possibilities for what our project could be. This doesn't always sit well with people. I do love a good tangent though because there is always more to learn. 
								</p>
								<h3>When Forming A Team</h3>
								<p>
									When forming a team I like to be the least knowledgeable person in the room that way I have the most to gain, I often choose logical team members over people who go with their gut, I find them easier to talk to because they can describe why they made certain choices instead of saying “I felt like it” 

									If I could find an J type personality to keep the team on track, I'm sure that we would cover lots of ground.

									<h3>My Project</h3>
									<p>
										My project idea is a weather proof security camera that turns on when a motion sensor is triggered capturing video, it uses an Infared light to see in the dark. The security camera will be powered by an external power bank (like the ones commonly used to charge mobile phones).  
										<br>
										It will also be possible to connect the camera to Wi-Fi so that the camera can interact with a phone application. The phone application would give you the ability to view the live image from the camera as well as previously taken footage and battery status. It would even be possible to move the camera with app control. 
									</p>
									<h3>Motivation</h3>
									<p>
										A motion triggered security camera would have many applications, also it would appeal to many target markets, the first three that come to mind are the home security industry.  
										<br>
										Budget directs home invasion statistics suggest that in 2017 there were 225900 recorded burglaries in Australia, that’s one burglary every three minutes this product could give piece of mind to those who have been previously victimized. (budget direct.com).  
										<br>
										There were more than 300000 births in Australia in 2019 it could appeal to new parents that could use their baby monitor once their child is grown as a home security camera, (macrotrends.net)  
										<br>
										According to rspca.org.au there are over 29 million pets in Australia alone. Many people want to know what trouble their cat / dog’s / fish gets up to when they are not around. 
									</p>
									<h3>Description</h3> 
									<p>
										When the security cameras motion sensor is triggered by an object moving within a certain radius, the camera will record video and turn on its infrared lights. Objects will still be visible to the camera in no and low light stations, because Infared LEDs produce light that a camera can pick up but our eyes cannot detect it will be difficult for the subject being recorded to know they are being recorded. 
										<br>
										It will be possible to use the camera both inside and outside because of its waterproof shell and waterproof seal protecting its electrical components. It is also easily mountable and will come with mounting brackets both permanent fixtures and semi-permanent. The camera would to sit on a flat surface without the need for mounting at all.  
										<br>
										The security camera would have the flexibility of being powered by an external battery housed within the waterproof shell meaning that you would not need to dismount the whole camera for charging this would be especially convenient if you had multiple cameras. 

										<br><br>

										The camera itself would interact with Wi-Fi, it would communicate with a software application that would be compatible with windows, Linux, macOS, as well as android and iPhone. Using the Rasbery pi as a server it would then be possible to view the live feed from the camera or download and view previous videos that have been stored. It would also be possible to automatically send videos to other computers to store directly on their hard-drives through the Wi-Fi connection incase the camera itself was destroyed.  
										<br>
										The software application would display the battery percentage, also have simple functions such as moving the camera up and down left and right. 
									</p>
									<h3>Hardware/Software</h3>
									<p>
									
									
 

										Raspberry pi 4: a raspberry pi is a cheap small computer that could be used as a desk top computer, more importantly the raspberry pi has I/O (input / output) pins that are used to control different types of sensors, motors or anything that can run off of electricity.   
										<br>
										The raspberry pi will control the input sensors such as the motion sensor and the output features like the infrared lights, servo motors and raspberry pi camera. It would also be used as a server to access files on the raspberry pi remotely by app. 
										<br><br>
										 
										
										An Sd card is a convenient way of storing data it will be used to store recordings, hold the raspberry pi’s operating system and coding. 
										
										<br><br>
										
										Servo motors are a type of cheap small motors, they will be used to position/move the camera up, down and left and right. 
										<br><br>
										 
										
										Infared LEDs are LEDs that emit light with a higher wave length then our own eyes can perceive they are for or the camera to see in the dark. 
										<br><br>
										 
										
										Motion sensors pick up Infared light emitted from our body heat they are used to detect objects close by. 
										<br><br>
										 
										
										External power banks will be the battery for powering the whole project. 
										<br><br>
										 
										
										Wire is used transport electricity and signals. 
										<br><br>
										 
										
										A raspberry pi camera is a small cheap camera that turns on when you send a small voltage to it. 
										<br><br>
										
								
										 
										
										Mounting brackets: To keep the camera suspended where we want it. 
										<br><br>
										 
										
										A cat, for testing purposes and cuteness.  
										<br><br>
										 
										
										Visual studio is an IDE used with the .net open source development platform, with it you can build websites and software for Linux, Microsoft and macOS using C# & F# 
										<br><br>
										 
										
										Xamarin is a .net open source platform used to build native android and iOS apps using C# & F#. 
										<br><br>
										 
										<h3>Skills Required</h3>
										The project would require several pieces of software to be written, firstly it would require the input/output configuration for the motion sensor, LED’s and raspberry pi camera to be written in python on the Rasbery pi OS. Knowledge of the raspberry pi command line interface would also be advantageous.  
										<br>
										Another python program would be written to take the video from the raspberry pi and put it in an accessible place on the Internet for the cross-platform application to access live and download previous videos.  
										<br>
										Another python program would be written to accept commands from the cross-platform software application. Giving it the ability to move the camera up down.  
										<br>
										There is also need for the cross-platform software application itself and it would need to run on Linux, windows and mac OS. It would be created using visual studio, .net and c#. 
										<br>
										Another cross-platform software application for android and iOS would also need to be created also using Visual studio and Xamarin. 
										<br><br>
										 
										
										This project would give people a cheap effective way of seeing what their cat gets up to when they are not home. It could also help prosecute intruders, thieves, and keep people's belongings safe when they are not there to do it themselves.
